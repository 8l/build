###Lightweight, portable and flexible operating system

alphaOS is a simple and minimalistic Linux distribution for the x86-64 architecture, built using Linux Live Kit set of scripts developed by Tomas M. It is based on Arch Linux and uses pacman as the default package manager. This operating system features highly configurable and lightweight Openbox window manager. Modular by design, alphaOS makes it easy to add desired functionality. 

This repository contains all bash scripts used for making alphaOS Linux based live CDs, and also set of several home-grown applications written in Vala and GTK+3: Emendo - text editor with syntax highlighting, Simple Radio - play online radio stations from the system tray, Taeni - terminal emulator, and others located in the def-scripts/03_extra directory.
